+ Run through priority coordinates. If force is True, run it no matter what. Otherwise, check that these coordinates have not been run.
+ After selecting a priority coordinate, set processing to True
+ After finished processing, set processed=True
+ If priority coordinates is empty, pull a coordinate from possible_coordinates at random (where is_processing is False)
+ When a coordinate is selected, check that it passes the test of how many of its nearest neighbors have been segmented. If it passes, set is_processing of its constituents to True.
+ After getting segments, check global_max_id, then update with that segments max
+ After getting segments, push each to the segments table
+ After getting segments, set all of its coordinates processed to True
+ After getting segments, push it's neighbors to priority according to the max_probability on each face
